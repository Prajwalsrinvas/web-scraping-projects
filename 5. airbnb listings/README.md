Scraping [this site](https://www.airbnb.co.in/s/bangalore/homes) to:
- Search for a given location for homes in the airbnb site.
- Scraping the name,type,size,amenities,price,ratings and number of reviews from multiple pages using BeautifulSoup.
- Storing all the scraped data in a csv file for easy access.
