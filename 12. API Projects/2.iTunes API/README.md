# iTunes APIðŸŽ¸

- Learned to interact with the [iTunes API](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/) using python and the requests library.
- Explored different types of endpoints and responses of the API.
- Learned to use the [params keyword argument](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/quickstart/#passing-parameters-in-urls) in requests.get() method instead of hardcoding urls for robustness.
- Learned to wrangle with the response data and made a neat pandas dataframe with [Ritviz](https://music.apple.com/in/artist/ritviz/1130337733) songs in chronological order.

- Exported data of [Alan Walker](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/alan-walker/1062085272) songs in the form of a [csv](https://github.com/Prajwalsrinvas/web-scraping-projects/blob/main/12.%20API%20Projects/2.iTunes%20API/alan_walker_songs.csv) file for any further use.
