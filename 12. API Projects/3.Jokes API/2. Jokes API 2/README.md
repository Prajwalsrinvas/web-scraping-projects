# Jokes API 2

- Learned to interact with a [Jokes API](https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api) using python and the requests library.
- Explored different types of endpoints and responses of the API.
- Used the [random joke](https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/jokes/random) endpoint and [ten random jokes](https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/jokes/ten) endpoint to print out jokes in a neat format.



- Created a dataframe containing all jokes by directly accessing the [JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api/master/jokes/index.json) that the API uses (as the API does not have an all jokes endpoint)

![jokes dataframe](https://github.com/Prajwalsrinvas/web-scraping-projects/blob/main/12.%20API%20Projects/3.Jokes%20API/2.%20Jokes%20API%202/jokedf.png)

- Exported dataframe as a [csv file](https://github.com/Prajwalsrinvas/web-scraping-projects/blob/main/12.%20API%20Projects/3.Jokes%20API/2.%20Jokes%20API%202/all_jokes.csv) for any further use.
