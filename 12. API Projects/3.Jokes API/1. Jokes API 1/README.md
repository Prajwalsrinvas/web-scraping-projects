# Jokes API 1

- Learned to interact with a [Jokes API](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/) using python and the requests library.
- Explored different types of endpoints, parameters and responses of the API.
- Learned to wrangle with the response data and created text files containing jokes for each category.

- Created a dataframe containing all jokes sorted by category

- Exported dataframe as a [csv file](https://github.com/Prajwalsrinvas/web-scraping-projects/blob/main/12.%20API%20Projects/3.Jokes%20API/1.%20Jokes%20API%201/all_jokes.csv) for any further use.
